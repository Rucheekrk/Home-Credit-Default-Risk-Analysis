Overview: This project implements a machine-learning pipeline designed to assess loan application risks using historical data. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, we aim to streamline the loan approval process and improve decision-making for financial institutions.

Objectives

Assess Credit Worthiness: Develop predictive models that enable lenders to make informed decisions about extending credit, ensuring responsible lending practices.

Risk Management: Implement data profiling to predict potential borrower defaults, allowing lenders to tailor strategies and mitigate risks effectively. 

Access to Competitive Loans: Enhance the evaluation of borrowers with limited credit histories, providing them with better loan opportunities.

Importance
Effective loan risk management is essential for the financial stability and profitability of lending institutions. Our automated, data-driven solution minimizes errors associated with manual assessments and enhances the accuracy of risk predictions, ultimately reducing default rates and financial losses.

Note: The dataset cannot be shared due to its large size, which exceeds repository limits.
